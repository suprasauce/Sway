# Sway
This project titled “Sway” approaches the idea of neuroevolution by using the NEAT algorithm to point towards an optimal solution for the given task. The environment is set up as a virtual simulation in an accelerated time frame and NEAT is performed over generations until a solution is achieved. The task involves determining various dynamic values which help propagate the motion of entities in the virtual simulation towards a favourable direction leading to an optimum.
