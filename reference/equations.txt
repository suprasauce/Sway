Non - linear motion of pendulum:
    theta1 = angle at time t
    L = length of string
    g = 9.8
    b = 0.1 (damping coefficient)
    m = 1 (mass of bob)

    theta1" + b/m*(theta1') + g/L*(sin(theta1)) = 0
    differentiation is w.r.t time

    theta2 = theta1'
    theta2' = -(b/m*(theta2) + g/L*(sin(theta1)))

    theta1' is differentiation of angle w.r.t time which is called angular
    velocity, so theta2 = angular velocity

    initial conditions:
    angle and angluar velocity both are set zero
